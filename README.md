# Genetic Algorithm in Ruby

Solving the 1-max problem with a simple GA, wrote as a quick-hack live machine learning demonstration.

The first commit already has basic features, then I show how simple additions (elitism and more mutation) rapidly increase performance.

I like to use GAs to explain Machine Learning: 
 - Based on an intuition everybody is familiar with (natural evolution)
 - No math is involved (uncommon in ML), hence none is required from the audience
 - The execution loop is absolutely straightforward
 - The genetic operators provide a natural way to organize the code into small-sized functions
 - Once cleaned up there is very little code at all

Code style is uneven because focus was put on teaching/explaining rather than execution.
